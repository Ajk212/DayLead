# Design Overview


# Description
With most modern devices and apps, accounts need to be made and internet connections are required. Tools to help productivity suffer due to these demands since they can lead users away from their goals.  The DayLead is a personal assistant device designed to combat unneeded services and boost productivity. There are no WiFi or Bluetooth connections, meaning the device is completely offline, allowing work to be done without distraction or interruptions. The design comprises a 10.1" touchscreen monitor paired with a Raspberry Pi 4b. These devices connect seamlessly in a wall-mounted enclosure which can be placed anywhere due to the convenient size.
